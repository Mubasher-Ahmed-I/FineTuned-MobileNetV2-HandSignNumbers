# Hand Sign Number Recognition with Fine-Tuned MobileNet

This project uses a MobileNet model to recognize hand signs representing numbers from 0 to 9. The MobileNet model has been fine-tuned to work well with hand gestures and can run on devices with limited resources, like mobile phones.

## What’s in this Project?

- A model (MobileNet) that can recognize hand signs for numbers (0-9).
- The model has been trained and fine-tuned to improve its accuracy.
- It can work quickly on devices with less computing power.

## Install TensorFlow
Make sure you have TensorFlow and Keras installed:

--pip install tensorflow keras

## Dataset

## Results
The model has been fine-tuned and achieves around about 95% accuracy when recognizing hand sign numbers. It’s fast and works well on mobile devices.
